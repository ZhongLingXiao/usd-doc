 - 出现python27_d.lib LINK的问题

    I changed
    
    1. 打开文件C:\Python27\include\pyconfig.h
    
    2. 注释掉 //#define Py_DEBUG

    3. 修改
    ifdef _DEBUG
    #	pragma comment(lib,"python27_d.lib")
    To 
    ifdef _DEBUG
    #	pragma comment(lib,"python27.lib")

    Made a copy of python27.lib and rename it python27_d.lib
    And build usd with –maya flag works now

    重新安装相应版本的python，然后选择fix python


 - Windows10安装maya-usd的方式

    I have done multiple tests trying to compile usd_maya repo. I have achieved to compile it in 2 different ways.

    * With CMake. Using CMake directly is cool because you can setup all variables in UI and you can easily check the values of the different arguments for compilation. The problem

    is that the libraries are generated in different folders and you need to a lot of manual work to create a proper data folder structure to make everything work as expected.

    * Using build.py usd_maya script. This is the quickest and easy way of building the library.

    1. Make sure that you have devkit installed in your Maya installation folder.

    2. Make sure that your Python has installed PyOpenGL and PySide

        2.1. Go to Scripts folder in your Python directory and call pip install PySide (necessary to work with usdview)

        2.2. Go to Scripts folder in your Python directory and call pip install PyOpenGL (necessary to work usdview)

    3. Launch command line and make sure vcvarsall.bat is launched. You can do in 2 different ways:

        3.1. Launch cmd and call "%VS140COMNTOOLS%..\..\VC\vcvarsall.bat"

        3.2. Launch vs2015 x64 native system tool symbols command line. This will automatically call vcvarsall.bat for you.

    4. Clone USD Pixar repository: https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD

        1.1. We MUST use the same USD version that Maya USD plugin is supporting.

            1.1.1. git clone https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD

            1.1.2. cd USD

            1.1.3. git checkout v19.05

    5. Open cmd and go to: USD\build_scripts

    6. In that folder, call in cmd: "C:\Python27\python.exe" build_usd.py --build-args boost,"--with-date_time --with-thread --with-system --with-filesystem" --no-maya C:\usd

    NOTE: It's important to intall those specific Boost libraries because AL_USD needs them.

    7. Wait until the process finishes. This can take some time.

    8. Check output in cmd, it will tell you to add some paths into environment variables. Do it.

        7.1. Add C:\usd\lib\python into PYTHONPATH

        7.2. Add C:\usd\bin

        7.3. Add C:\usd\lib

    9. Clone USD_Maya repository: git clone https://github.com/Autodesk/maya-usd.git

    10. USD in Windows has a problem with pxrTargets.cmake. Some libraries (hdStream, usdObj & usdShaders) are dynamic libs and have no .lib files on Windows. 

        9.1. Go to C:\usd\cmake and open pxrTargets.cmake

        9.2. Search for "if(NOT EXISTS "${file}" 433

        9.3. Replace that line with the following code:

    # =============================================================================================

    get_filename_component(barename "${file}" NAME_WE)

        # HACK - the following are dynamic libs in Windows (no .lib) - these will be dll's only

        set(skip_dynamic_libs "hdStream" "usdObj" "usdShaders")

        list(FIND skip_dynamic_libs ${barename} _index)

        if(NOT EXISTS "${file}" AND NOT ((${_index} GREATER -1) AND WIN32))

    # =============================================================================================

    11. I have also detected some problems during build when FindUSD does not find usdGenSchema file. 

        10.1. Go to your USD repo folder (not the installation) and go to USD\pxr\usd\lib\usd. There you will find a file called usdGenSchema.py

        10.2. Copy that file and paste it in C:\usd\bin

        10.3. Also remove the .py extension from that file and rename only to usdGenSchema

    12. Open cmd and go to maya-usd root repositoy folder

    13. In that folder, call in cmd: "C:\Python27\python.exe" build.py --maya-location "C:\Program Files\Autodesk\maya2018" --pxrusd-location C:\usd C:\usd-maya

    14. Wait until the process finishes. This can take some time.

    15. Go to C:\usd-maya\install\RelWithDebInfo. In that folder you will find mayaUSD.mod file.

    16. Copy that file and paste in documents/maya/2018/modules

    17. Open that file in your text editor and replace it with the following context:

    # =============================================================================================

    + USD 19.05 C:\usd

    PYTHONPATH+:=lib/python

    PATH+:=bin

    PATH+:=lib

    + PXR_USDMAYA 19.05 C:\usd-maya\install\RelWithDebInfo\plugin\pxr

    PYTHONPATH+:=lib/python

    PATH+:=maya/lib

    XBMLANGPATH+:=maya/lib/usd/usdMaya/resources

    MAYA_SCRIPT_PATH+:=maya/lib/usd/usdMaya/resources

    MAYA_PLUG_IN_PATH+:=maya/plugin

    PXR_PLUGINPATH_NAME+:=lib/usd

    + AL_USDMaya 0.34.0 C:\usd-maya\install\RelWithDebInfo\plugin\al

    PYTHONPATH+:=lib/python

    PATH+:=lib

    MAYA_PLUG_IN_PATH+:=plugin

    PXR_PLUGINPATH_NAME+:=lib/usd

    # =============================================================================================

    18. Launch Maya 2018

    19. Now you need to load AL_USD plugin

    # =============================================================================================

    from maya import cmds

    cmds.loadPlugin('AL_USDMayaPlugin') 

    # =============================================================================================

    20. USD menu will be created and you will be able to create Proxy Shapes

    You need to build with --devkit-location so that UFE devkit can be found and compiled with.
